# FishFight
First attempt at lobGDX Android game (excluding a tutorial)

(free, no ads)

Throughout the code I was at various stages of learning Java, libGdx and Android Studio, so some questionable (wrong) choices are made. 
A lot of things in the PlayState class should have been methods, and some (the penguins) would have worked better as new classes. 

Tutorial on libGdx I used as a primer is "LibGDX - How To Make Video Games: Flappy Bird" by Brent Aureli

Game is based on "Hey, that's my Fish!" designed by Alvydas Jakeliunas and most recently published by Fantasy Flight Games.  
Please consider purchasing the official app or the board game if you enjoy the game or this code is helpful.
